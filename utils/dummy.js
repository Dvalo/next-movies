        overview: "I was born under unusual circumstances. And so begins. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, adapted from the 1920s story by F. Scott Fitzgerald about a man who is born in his eighties and ages backwards: a man, like any of us, who is unable to stop time. We follow his story, set in New Orleans, from the end of World War I in 1918 into the 21st century, following his journey that is as unusual as any man's life can be. Directed by David Fincher and starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett with Taraji P. Henson, Tilda Swinton, Jason Flemyng, Elias Koteas and Julia Ormond, Benjamin Button, is a grand tale of a not-so-ordinary man and the people and places he discovers along the way, the loves he finds, the joys of life and the sadness of death, and what lasts beyond time.",

        overview: "A virtual table read of the classic 1982 hit Fast Times at Ridgemont High. The all-star cast includes Jennifer Aniston, Dane Cook, Morgan Freeman, Jimmy Kimmel, Shia LaBeouf, John Legend, Ray Liotta, CORE co-founder Sean Penn, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts. This virtual special featured a series of memorable moments, including LaBeouf's hilariously accurate portrayal of Jeff Spicoli enjoyed by Penn himself, Morgan Freeman's dramatic narration, Julia Roberts (Stacy Hamilton) and Aniston's (Linda Barrett) adorable friendship, and a comical reenactment between Aniston (Linda) and Pitt (Brad Hamilton) as their characters shared a flirtatious scene in a daydream sequence. This event benefited CORE’s COVID-19 relief efforts to protect vulnerable communities as well as our friends at Reform Alliance.",

Volume 1 captures two hours of only the very twisted of psycho TV from Japan. Much of this party tape utilizes footage from bizarre and cruel game shows. Rounding out the tape are some great cheesey commercials, mostly for foods that look grossly unappetizing, and some with sell out American celebrities. A few scenes are shown from various weird Far East movies.",
